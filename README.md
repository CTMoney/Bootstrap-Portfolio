# Responsive-Portfolio

<h1>Pages</h1>


    <b>Home</b>:
        -  Links to projects
    
    <b>About</b>: 
        -  General info.
    
    <b>Contact</b>
        -  A working contact form that I hope to get working on sending me emails automatically through back-end;

-----------------------------

    <b>Overall</b>:
    
        - I'd like to change the style to be somewhat more appealing

        - Adding ajax functionality seems like a nice idea as well

        - Maybe using different front-end frameworks for each different page
