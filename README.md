<h1>Pages</h1>


    Home:
        -  Links to projects
    
    About: 
        -  General info.
    
    Contact:
        -  A working contact form that I hope to get working on sending me emails automatically through back-end;

-----------------------------

    Overall:

        - I'd like to change the style to be somewhat more appealing

        - Adding ajax functionality seems like a nice idea as well

        - Maybe using different front-end frameworks for each different page
