<h1>Pages</h1>


    <h3>Home</h3>:
        -  Links to projects
    
    <h3>About</h3>: 
        -  General info.
    
    <h3>Contact</h3>
        -  A working contact form that I hope to get working on sending me emails automatically through back-end;

-----------------------------

    <h3>Overall</h3>:

        - I'd like to change the style to be somewhat more appealing

        - Adding ajax functionality seems like a nice idea as well

        - Maybe using different front-end frameworks for each different page
